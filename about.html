        <h2>About My Cat, Again</h2>
        <p>Seriously, I'm a nobody. If you look for my presence on the web, you're not going to find much outside of a Facebook account that I haven't logged into for several years because I'm too lazy to request a password reset so I can delete the stupid thing. I don't use Twitter because I believe that 120 characters is completely insufficient for expressing a coherent opinion. And I don't use any other social media site because I'm part of the group of our generation who was raised to think that using your real name on the internet is dumb. And unfortunately, based on the crusades that occur almost weekly over a difference of opinion where instead of debating or arguing differences, people instead contact employers and state that they've hired a known Nazi and white supremicist, it's looking like it wasn't such a bad idea.<br><br>

        So instead, I'm going to talk about my cat again.<br><br>
        This bundle of softness enjoys being exactly wherever you'd prefer she not be at that specific moment in time. If you want to get up and work on something elsewhere, she'll be on your lap. If you want to eat dinner, she'll be on the table waiting for a water glass to be placed down so she can get the first sip. If you want ice cream, she will move as close as felinely possible and stare. And stare. And lick her lips. And if it's that time of the year again to take her to the vet, she's going to be underneath that one bed that you can't reach until you've demolished or disassembled most of the room just to get enough space to grab her. <br><br>
        Here's some reasons why cats are better than us:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cats get to sleep up to twenty hours per day</li>
          <li>Cats have remarkable strength, endurance and agility for their size</li>
          <li>Cats can hear noises that fall outside of our audible spectrum</li>
          <li>Cats are the only species that has perfected the art of training people</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, owning a cat is like owning your own private Batman. Adopt a cat.
