            <h2>SQL</h2>
            <p>The art of database programming and management is much like making an Excell spreadsheet that's on several different kinds of steroids and depressents and is debating how miserable your life should be that day. For additional fun, try writing code for Microsoft SQL on a Mac. For even more fun, install MySQL that crashes when the planets don't align.

            <h2>Assembly</h2>
              <p>I am skilled in the dark arts of finding two matching parts and making them stick together. This means that not only can I build very large and complex Lego structues, I can assemble computers and take them apart again when something goes wrong. Mostly, this involves removing all of the accumulated cat hair from the fans. On ocassion, more complex assembly is required.

            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>Despite how it often appears in movies, programming requires a great deal of trial and error instead of a quick tap of the keyboard. This requires utmost patience and restraint to avoid hurling your monitor across the room when that one bloody semicolon completely breaks your for loop and it took several hours of debugging to realize this. For reasons unknown, this is something I enjoy doing.

          <h1>More About My Cat</h1>
          <p>The internet is for two things, and one of them is cat photographs. Who cares about me, have a picture of my cat. For anyone reading this who does not own a cat, affectionate is not the appropriate word to describe a cat's behavior. Bipolar, or perhaps schizophrenic conveys a far more enlightening viewpoint. Yes, the domestic cat is one of the more adorable animals to adorn our households, and yes, kittens are the cutest thing you will find on this planet. But once past kittenhood, cats are soft bundles of the smoothest fur that contains a surprisingly large number of sharp pointy bits that are cunningly concealed by an appearance you'd never think would maul you until it's actively happening. While the animal may still be friendly, it is friendly on its terms, at its time. Is the cat laying on its back, paws up in the air, belly stretched out, eyes gazing out at you pleading for you to stroke that expanse of fur that feels like an angel's caress? Perhaps. Or it's a whiskered bear trap waiting to be sprung on an unsuspecting victim. If you have trouble sleeping due to dreams of crushing weights, that means that you need to wake up and convince the cat that sleeping on your chest is far from an ideal resting position. Is the cat sharpening its claws on your couch despite all pleading and offering of alternative surfaces and objects? Give it a week and you can resell the couch as a well-used scratching post. Thinking about getting some work done at your desk? Best hope the cat has no interest in the chair you're sitting in or the keyboard you're using.</p>
          <p>This is why you get a dog for the cat to harass instead.</p>
